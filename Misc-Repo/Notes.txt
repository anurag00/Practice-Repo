_______Twitter api fix______


Unfortunately, this isn't currently well documented in the Tweepy docs, but the Status objects returned by Tweepy actually come in three varieties:

    "Basic" tweets (you "Compose" a tweet on Twitter)
    Retweets (you hit "Retweet" on another person's tweet, but don't add any comment)
    "Quote" tweets (you hit "Retweet" on another person's tweet and add a comment)

To get the full text for each of these, you need to access the _json property for each Status object (which is a Python dict).

    For "basic" & "quote" tweets <= 140 characters, you can simply use status._json["text"].

    For "basic" & "quote" tweets > 140 characters, you use status._json["extended_tweet"]["full_text"]. In this case, status._json["extended_tweet"] contains a reference to the full non-truncated tweet.

    For retweets (of any length), using status._json["retweeted_status"] will give you a reference to the retweeted tweet

    If the retweeted tweet is <= 140 characters, use status._json["retweeted_status"]["text"]

    If the retweeted tweet is > 140 characters, use status._json["retweeted_status"]["extended_tweet"]["full_text"]

You can find an example of a typical status._json object here for a <= 140 character "basic" tweet.
